# Gatehinge
Quickly switch network gateways


## Motivation
My dad was rich enough to have two internet connections active at his house. One connection uses a 4G mobile network, fast, but metered. The other connection is slow, but unlimited. 
In order to use both connections seemlessly, my dad needed a way of switching inbetween the "internets" quickly and easily. So I made this.

## Installation
1. `qmake`
2. `make`
3. `./gatehinge` (run with sudo so it can edit the routing table)
